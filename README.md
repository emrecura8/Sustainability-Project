# Sustainability-Project
I have created a website with my teammate which has a login and register page, multiple user verification. These users have different authorizations and they can add, update or delete their projects. There are 4 type of users. Student, admin, instructor and firm users. They all have different authorizations.

This is login page. There is four types of users but two types of login part. You can also register or list projects without logining from navigation menu.

This is main page for student users. Students can list only their projects and they can add, edit or delete their projects. They can also logout from the session. System will remember their session if they will not logout.
